## Implementation

The app consists of 3 main modules. Model, View, and UI. In Pasta, only one module exists for each role. The model handles all the data the app uses. The view is just a glue between the model and the UI. The UI module handles all the rendering and some controller job.

## Running

Open index.html in your favourite browser.
